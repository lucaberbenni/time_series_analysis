This project focuses on temperature forecasting using historical weather data. It leverages machine learning techniques to predict temperatures based on various features such as date, year, month, and day. The project aims to explore time series analysis, polynomial regression, and model evaluation for accurate temperature predictions.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The project starts with importing and cleaning the weather data. The dataset is loaded from a file and processed to remove unnecessary columns and convert the date format. The temperature values are normalized by dividing them by 10 for consistency. 

### Modeling and Training

The project utilizes linear regression models to predict temperature. Two models are trained: one on data after World War II and another on data before World War II. Polynomial features are introduced to capture higher-order relationships between the features. The models are trained on the transformed data, and predictions are made.

### Handling Null Values

The trained models are used to predict temperature values for missing or null entries in the dataset. The historical weather data containing null quality values is transformed using the same pipeline, and predictions are generated using the appropriate model. The results from both models are combined to obtain more accurate predictions.

### Time Series Analysis

The project incorporates time series analysis techniques to capture temporal patterns in the temperature data. A linear regression model is trained to capture the overall trend in the temperature time series. Monthly seasonality is also considered by creating dummy variables for each month. The model is fitted using the transformed data, and predictions are made for the trend and seasonal components.

### Evaluating Forecasts

To evaluate the quality of the temperature forecasts, the project splits the dataset into training and test sets. The training set is used to train a full model that considers the trend, seasonal, and lagged components. The model is evaluated using cross-validation techniques on the training set. Finally, the trained model is used to forecast temperatures in the test set, and the accuracy of the forecasts is assessed.

### Future Prediction

The project concludes by making a future temperature prediction. The trained model is used to forecast the temperature for a future time point by providing the necessary input features such as timestep, month dummies, and the lagged component. The prediction can be used to estimate temperature trends in the future.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and time series analysis techniques for temperature forecasting. The combination of polynomial regression, time series modeling, and evaluation methods helps improve the accuracy of temperature predictions.
